# BAM! Recipe
BAM! Recipe is a iOS application that provides users with recipes. The recipes are sourced from our database through the input users give including a cuisine type (e.g. Chinese, American, etc.), a food type (e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc.), and ingredients they have available to them. The application's aim is to provide accurate recipes using the users' inputs as well as creating convenience for users at home and minimizing food waste.
